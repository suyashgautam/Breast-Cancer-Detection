# Breast-Cancer-Detection

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

Detect stage of cancer from benign or malignant.
Best 93.96% accuracy by DecisionTreeClassifier of scikit learn.
96% accuracy by simple 1 hidden layer neural net. Trained with 100 epochs. Having more hidden layers may increase accuracy a little. But it may not generalize and overfit the train data.

Tried several models on the same dataset. I have also tried ensambling of several models, but it turns out that simple DecisionTreeClassifier beats them.
